I am a software engineer at Stream Computing @ ByteDance, aiming to make [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) more efficient and more user-friendly.

Before that, I got my master's degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and bachelor's degree from New York University Shanghai (NYUSH), both in Computer Science.

I was born and raised in Suzhou, and am currently living in Hangzhou. As the old saying goes: "Up above there is heaven; down below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou". I also had the luck to live and study in two amazing cityies: Shanghai and New York, and a peaceful academic town: Champaign.

I'm blessed with a lovely wife who is always enthusiastic in exploring the beauty of the world and creating wonderful graphical designs, check out more [here](https://susanxx.com/).
